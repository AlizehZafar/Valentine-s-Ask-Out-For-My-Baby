            I don't think words can express how much I love you and how grateful I am to have you. 
            I want to spend this valentines and many others to come, just with you. 
            I couldn't have asked for a better life partner, who would stay more at my side than you do, 
            who would take care of me as much as you do, love me as much as you do. 
            Thank you for also focusing on my dreams and goals. I hope we continue to love and respect each other as we have been doing so far, 
            and that our honeymoon phase never ends.
